# To Do

- [ ] Create a script that accepts as arguments:
  - [ ] a crypto e.g. ETH, or BTC
  - [ ] a dip threshold in cents, or percentage
- [ ] When run, it compares the price of the crypto to a previous price, and sends you a notification when it detects a price dip that surpasses the passed threshold.
- [ ] Notification media include:
  - [ ] Email
  - [ ] Custom
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add a guide, so anyone can deploy it for themselves
